The user will be shown a word in Spanish, and then prompted to type in the corresponding word in English.

How can I start using this study tool?
--------------------------------------
Using this tool is pretty darn easy to use. Just make sure you have the Scala programming language installed so you can run the source code. 

On Eclipse IDE:
- Scala must be installed on Eclipse to run Scala projects. If not yet set up go to: http://scala-ide.org/docs/user/gettingstarted.html

- Download all of the .scala files in the src folder. From there you want to run the Translator.scala file. When you run this file, the program will start!

On Mac Terminal: 
- Verify if you have scala installed by typing the command at command prompt:

  $ scala -version
  
  then enter return and you should see something similar to:
  
  javac 1.7.0_51
  MacBook-Pro:bin MacBookPro$ scala -version
  Scala code runner version 2.10.4 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL
  
- If scala is not install then install it and come back. If scala is install, navigate into folder that holds Translator.scala file and type the command at command prompt:
 
  $ scala Translator.scala
  
  then enter return and enjoy!
